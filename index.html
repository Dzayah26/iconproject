<p> On September 1 the U.S. Supreme Court failed to block the measure on an emergency appeal on Texas senate bill 8. The bill will now prohibit women from getting abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy, completely undermining the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe V. Wade. What makes this bill even worse is how the law is enforced, raising many safety concerns for those in Texas wanting an abortion.
  </p>

<p>
This unprecedented law is the first of its kind and could potentially inspire other conservative states to pass similar if not far more egregious laws. Here is a breakdown of the Texas abortion law and how it compares to other states.

<p> The Texas abortion law has been deemed the strictest abortion law in the counrty, what makes this bill so severe aside from banning abortions is that it allows private citizens to get involved in stopping the abortion process. Private citizens can sue an abortion provider or anyone they see helping a individual try to get an abortion a fine of $10,000. Texas citizens also do not have to have any personal connection to the individuals that they are suing. Creating this bounty hunter atmosphere for those that are thinking about getting an abortion. The Texas law also does not make an acception to cases of rape and incest as well, making this law even more egregious than other states. Abortion clinics across the state worked up until the bills passing for anyone that was wanting an abortion to avoid any fines. Now that the bill is effect Texas could see a number of problems such as illegal abortions, indiviuals leaving the state to get an abortion, and possbily death from illegal abortions. They could also see several cases tried in court challenging how effect the law is and whether it undermines Roe V. Wade.

<p>Similar in nature Georgia's "heartbeat" abortion bill bans any abortions after detecting a fetal heartbeat which in most cases most women don't know that they're pregnat. However, the laws differ by the Grogia law addressing Roe V. Wade as well as the constitutional merritts of abortion rights. The adressing of Roe V. Wade and constitutional merritts allowed Grorgia supreme court to rule against the law stating that it conflicts with supreme court precendent and violates the right to privacy and liberty under the 14th ammendment. However, the passing of Texas senate bill 8 could inspire Georgia to draft an abortion law similar in nature. Georgia's governor Brian Kemp is backing legislative efforts for the state to revise their abortion bill to have the similar layout of Texas.

<p>
Unlike Texas and Georgia, New York's Reproductive Health Act legalizes abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy and if the women's health is at risk. It also prohibits women from having abortions up to the moment of birth, which many pro-life advocates assume the act allows. The reproductive act allows mdeical practitioners to determine wheter a women's health is at risk during pregnacy and may need an abortion. Something that most if not all conservative states would allow this type of option to indiviudals wanting an abortion. The health/viability of the fetus was left out of the act which further encourages the medical practitioners to make the ethical decision of determining if the individuals health is at risk and needs an abortion.

<p> California's abortion laws are almost similar to New York's, govenor Gavin Newsom signed two new laws protecting the pricvacy of abortion providers and their patients in response to the Texas bill. One of the bills prohibits people from filming within 100 feet of an abortion clinic for the purpose of intimidation, creating more of a safe space for those that are wanting an abortion. California law also makes it illegal for indiviudals to post personal information about abortion providers and their paitents.
